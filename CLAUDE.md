# QBR — Project Map for Claude

## One-line pitch
**Quarterly Business Reports as a card game.** A Queen's Blood-shaped territory
card battle played on a 3x5 spreadsheet, headed toward a Balatro-shaped run:
bosses are meetings, jokers are desk supplies and software features, helpers are
keyboard shortcuts and sticky notes. Lore-light, vibe-heavy — the fiction is
corporate spreadsheet hell, which every player already knows, so nothing needs
explaining.

## Why this exists
Origin (2026-09-25): the ask was "a Gwent / Queen's Blood for mobile". Market read:
PvP live-service card games are contracting (Gwent is now community-run, Marvel
Snap's players are declining and its studio cut staff in 2026) and fail the
workspace rubric (servers, balance, content ops). Solo roguelike deckbuilders are
crowded, but a **grid-territory** card game on mobile is thin — no official
Queen's Blood port exists, only fan clones. QBR is that gap, skinned as a
spreadsheet because a lore-light, familiar-object fiction (Balatro = poker/casino)
beats inventing a world.

## Tech stack (same as cubes/ and chain/, deliberately)
- pnpm workspaces — `packages/{shared,client,sim}`.
- **shared**: pure, action-sourced reducer. No `window`/`document`/`react`/`node:*`.
  All randomness through `rngState` (mulberry32, same lineage as chain/cubes).
- **client**: React + TypeScript (Vite), **2D CSS/DOM renderer** (a real `<table>`
  is the board). Capacitor iOS wrap, appId `com.ashwink.qbr`, edge-to-edge.
- **sim**: headless measurement via tsx.

## Rules as built (one quarter = one round)
- Sheet is 3 rows (Sales / Ops / R&D) x 5 columns. You own column A, AI owns E,
  each home cell at budget `$` = 1.
- Place a card on an **empty cell you own whose budget >= card cost** ($-$$$).
  It **spreads** in its shape (drawn on the card): every empty cell reached
  becomes yours and gains +1 budget (cap 3). A cell taken from the opponent keeps
  its budget. Cells holding a card are never touched. Shapes are written from the
  left player's view and mirrored for the right.
- A row's value leader banks that row's total as revenue; ties bank nothing.
- Draw 1 per turn from each player's second turn. Two consecutive passes end the
  quarter. Both seats use the same 15-card `STARTER_DECK`, shuffled per seed.

## Phase 0 result (2026-09-25, `pnpm measure 2000`) — 2 of 4 pre-registered bars
| bar | result | |
|---|---|---|
| seat balance, greedy-vs-greedy first seat in [40,60]% | **49.9%** | PASS |
| skill floor, greedy beats random >= 80% | **77.0%** | FAIL (close) |
| **skill headroom, 2-ply lookahead beats greedy >= 55%** | **64.2%** | PASS |
| real choices, median plays >= 4 and <25% decisions with 0-1 plays | med **4**, thin **27.5%** | FAIL |

**The headroom result is the one that matters most and it passed comfortably:
thinking one reply ahead wins ~2:1, so the core is not shallow.**
**Diagnosis of the thin-decision fail, measured:** 20.2% of all decisions are a
player holding cards with **no empty cell of their own left** (boxed in); 4.8% are
"all cards too expensive"; 0.0% are an empty hand. The binding constraint is
**territory starvation**, a board-geometry problem, not card costs. Levers to test
next, one at a time against the same harness: a 6th column; a
"replace your own card" play (overwrite for an upgrade); spreads that can push
into enemy cells holding weaker cards. Do not move the pre-registered bars.

## Roadmap (not yet built)
1. Fix territory starvation (above) until bar 4 passes; recheck bars 1-3.
2. **Gwent layer:** best-of-3 quarters with passing as a real decision (currently
   policies only pass when forced, so passing is not yet measured at all).
3. **Balatro layer:** run of meetings as blinds — "Quick sync" / "Standup" /
   "Quarterly Review" boss — with boss rule-breakers (Micromanager locks a cell,
   Reply-All floods junk, Auditor halves your best row, Legacy System has
   unclaimable cells, final boss "The Board"). Jokers as desk objects (Coffee Mug,
   APPROVED stamp, Pivot Table rotates a shape, Newton's Cradle, Circular
   Reference wraps edges). Helpers as keycaps (Ctrl+C/V/X/Z) and sticky notes.
   Chain's Cascade Forge is the reference for the joker/blind plumbing.
4. Mascot: an original **binder clip** assistant (jaws = expressions). NOT
   Clippy/Clippit — that is Microsoft's character.

## IP guardrails — read before adding art, names or cards
- Mechanics are free; expression is not. Card names, text, art and characters must
  be original. Don't resemble Gwent factions, Queen's Blood card names, or the
  Cyberpunk TCG look.
- Evoke the 90s office; don't copy trade dress: no Excel green X, no Office
  ribbon, no Windows logo or BSOD, no Microsoft fonts, no Clippy, no flying
  toasters, no quoted Office Space lines or the red stapler as a direct homage.
- No AI-generated shipped art or card text — the card-game audience punishes it.
  Plan on a commissioned pixel artist (32-64px, 16-colour VGA-era palette).

## How to run
```
pnpm install
pnpm dev         # client on http://localhost:5176  (5173 casual, 5174 cubes, 5175 chain)
pnpm test        # shared rule tests + client DOM test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm measure     # Phase 0 report; optional arg = seeds per seat (default 1000)
```

## iOS Simulator
Same recipe as `chain/CLAUDE.md` ("Dev workflow — running on the iOS Simulator"),
with bundle id `com.ashwink.qbr`:
```
cd packages/client && pnpm build && pnpm exec cap sync ios && cd ios/App
xcodebuild -project App.xcodeproj -scheme App -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator \
  -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,id=<UDID>" -derivedDataPath ./build build
xcrun simctl install <UDID> ./build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/App.app
xcrun simctl launch <UDID> com.ashwink.qbr
```
Verified building and launching 2026-09-25. No signing team / Xcode Cloud setup yet.
Headless-Chrome screenshots below ~500px wide are cropped by Chrome's minimum window
width — that is not a layout bug; check on the Simulator instead.
